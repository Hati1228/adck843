    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: pong game</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of arrays, loops, and randomness. this is a two player game were both players are trying to score in each other areas. in this case player one is hit the ball in players two areas therefore meaning that player one get the point. then the ball resets its postion and then for example player two is hit the ball in players one areas therefore meaning that player two get the point.
